- Remember to use projections [Select(x => new TModel{ x.Property })].
- Use TPH to store anime and manga in the same table. Performance gains on searching on
  name for media outweigh "too many columns" issue, especially since we have EF handling
  that for us.
- Remember to add support for soft deletes.
- Remember to apply split queries when getting person information (see cartesian explosion)
- Constants in queries are bad for performance since similar queries need to be compiled.
  If two similar queries are run, try and shape them the say way and pass in a local variable.
  It seems the cost of grabbing the local and creating the expression is cheaper than EF
  recompiling a different expression.
